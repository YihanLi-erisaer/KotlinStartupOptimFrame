# Android Startup Optimization Framework

A Kotlin/Android library for **cold-start and pre–first-frame initialization**. It models startup work as a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of tasks, runs **independent branches in parallel** once their dependencies are satisfied (shortening wall-clock time toward the **critical path**), and provides registration, structured coroutine dispatch, **execution phases** (decouple from the first frame), **supervisor-style failure handling** (one task failure does not cancel siblings), **optional IO concurrency limits**, timing traces, and runtime wrappers (lazy once, timeout, priority override).

**Demo app:** `:app` · **Modules:** `:core` (engine), `:runtime` (optional wrappers), `:sample` (example tasks).

## 1. Why startup optimization matters

### 1.1 The problem

During **cold start**, an app typically must initialize logging, configuration, the network stack, local storage, SDKs (push, analytics, maps, and so on). A **naive pattern** is to run everything **sequentially** in a single coroutine or on the main thread:

- **Total time** is approximately the **sum** of all task durations, even when some tasks **do not depend on each other** and could overlap in time.
- Heavy work on the **main thread** increases jank and ANR risk; pushing everything to background threads without explicit ordering can break **implicit contracts** (for example, “configure logger before opening the network layer”).

### 1.2 What this framework does

- You declare **explicit dependencies** between named tasks (`dependencies: List<String>`).
- The scheduler runs tasks **only after** all predecessors have finished successfully (or marks dependents **skipped** if a dependency failed—see [§2.5](#25-failure-handling-supervisor-scope-and-skipped-tasks)), and **overlaps** work where the graph allows (subject to thread choice via `runOnMainThread` and optional **IO concurrency caps**).
- You can split work by **`ExecutionPhase`** and trigger later phases after the first frame or main **idle**, so non-critical work does not compete with first layout.
- Initialization is **centralized** and **testable**, instead of ad-hoc call chains scattered across `Application` and feature code.

---

## 2. How this framework optimizes startup (principles)

### 2.1 Model startup as a DAG

- Each task has a unique **`id`**.
- Each entry in **`dependencies`** is the `id` of a task that must **complete successfully** before this task may run (or the dependent is **skipped** if a dependency failed).
- The global graph must be a **DAG** (no cycles). If a cycle exists, `sortTasks` / phase planning fails with a clear error.
- **`validateDependencyPhases`** ensures a task never depends on a **later** [`ExecutionPhase`](#24-execution-phases) than its own (dependencies must be same or **earlier** phase).

Intuitively:

- Tasks with **no blocking dependencies** (within the current phase, given satisfied earlier phases) can be scheduled.
- When **several tasks** can run, they may **run concurrently** (on IO or main, per `runOnMainThread`), **subject to** the optional **IO semaphore** (see [§2.6](#26-io-concurrency-limit)).

The **optimization** does not reduce a single `run()`’s own duration; it **reduces total wall-clock time** by **overlapping** independent or partially independent work so end-to-end time moves toward the **critical path** of the graph.

### 2.2 Topological sort (Kahn’s algorithm + priority queue)

**Monolithic graph:** `sortTasks` in `Dag.kt` (all tasks, single phase in terms of ordering).

1. **Validation:** **Unique** task ids; every dependency id **exists**; `validateDependencyPhases`.
2. **Graph:** edges, **in-degrees**, `PriorityQueue` for ready nodes ordered by **`priority`**, then **`id`**.

**Per execution phase:** `planRunnableTasksInPhase` first **drops** tasks whose dependencies appear in a **failed** set (from prior phases or same-phase outcomes), records those as **skipped** in the plan, then runs **Kahn** on the remaining tasks in that phase. Same priority/tie-break rules apply within the phase.

### 2.3 Concurrency: `join` dependencies, then `execute` (avoids deadlock)

`StartupManager` launches one **`Job` per task** in topological order for that phase. Inside each job:

1. For each `dependency` that is not already **satisfied from earlier successful phases**, **`join`** the corresponding **same-phase** `Job`, then check that dependency’s **outcome** (if it **failed**, this task is **skipped** and does not run `run()`).
2. **`StartupDispatcher.execute(task)`** runs `task.run()` in **`withContext`(`Main.immediate` or `IO`)** so exceptions are observable in the parent coroutine.
3. Non–main-thread work can be wrapped in **`Semaphore.withPermit`** when [`maxParallelIo`](#43-startupmanager) is set, to cap concurrent IO-style tasks.
4. **All** jobs in the phase are **joined** at the end of that phase.

**Why launch in topological order?** So predecessor `Job`s exist before a dependent could suspend waiting for them, avoiding a **deadlock** from scheduling order.

**Parallelism:** Independent branches in the same phase still **overlap in time** after their `join`s to predecessors complete.

### 2.4 Execution phases

[`ExecutionPhase`](core/src/main/kotlin/com/ikkoaudio/startup/core/ExecutionPhase.kt) (ordinal order):

| Phase | Typical use |
|--------|------------|
| **`BeforeFirstFrame`** | Earliest work (e.g. right after `Application` / `Activity` `onCreate` before first draw). |
| **`AfterFirstFrame`** | After one or more **Choreographer** frames, to avoid contending with measure/layout. |
| **`Idle`** | After the main **Looper** reports idle, for heavier deferred init. |

- **`StartupManager.start()`** runs **all non-empty phases in order** in one **`suspend` coroutine** (no real “wait for frame” between phases—suitable for tests or total work measurement).
- **`StartupManager.startPhase(phase, …)`** runs **one** phase; you call it from the app after **frames** or **idle** as needed.
- The demo [`runPhasedStartup`](app/src/main/kotlin/com/ikkoaudio/androidstartupoptimizationframework/startup/PhasedStartup.kt) chains `startPhase(BeforeFirstFrame)` → 2 frame callbacks → `startPhase(AfterFirstFrame)` → idle → `startPhase(Idle)`.

`StartupTask` exposes `executionPhase` (default **`BeforeFirstFrame`**).

### 2.5 Failure handling (supervisor scope and skipped tasks)

- Each **phase** runs in **`supervisorScope`**: if one task’s `run()` **throws** (other than `CancellationException`), **sibling** tasks in the same phase are **not** automatically cancelled; the error is stored in a [`TaskFailure`](core/src/main/kotlin/com/ikkoaudio/startup/core/StartupResult.kt).
- Tasks that **depend** on a failed task are **not run**; they are reported as [`SkippedTask`](core/src/main/kotlin/com/ikkoaudio/startup/core/StartupResult.kt) with a reason (and may also be pre-filtered in `planRunnableTasksInPhase` when `failedFromEarlier` is passed).
- **`startPhase` returns** a [`PhaseResult`](core/src/main/kotlin/com/ikkoaudio/startup/core/StartupResult.kt) with **`successTaskIds`**, **`failures`**, and **`skipped`**.
- **`start` returns** [`FullStartupResult`](core/src/main/kotlin/com/ikkoaudio/startup/core/StartupResult.kt) (`phaseResults` per phase, plus helpers `allFailures`, `isOverallSuccess`, etc.).

### 2.6 IO concurrency limit

- **`StartupManager(..., maxParallelIo = n)`** (optional) installs a **kotlinx** [`Semaphore(n)`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.sync/-semaphore/): only **non–main-thread** tasks (`runOnMainThread == false`) acquire a permit for the duration of `execute()`. **Main-thread** tasks are not limited. **`null` / default** means no limit (the demo uses **`4`** in `MainActivity`).

### 2.7 “Traditional” baseline in this repo

[`NaiveJetpackStyleStartup`](app/src/main/kotlin/com/ikkoaudio/androidstartupoptimizationframework/benchmark/NaiveJetpackStyleStartup.kt) simulates a **single coroutine** with a **fixed order** of `run()` calls (no DAG parallelism for independent branches). [`StartupComparisonScreen`](app/src/main/kotlin/com/ikkoaudio/androidstartupoptimizationframework/ui/StartupComparisonScreen.kt) compares its wall time to the **phased** framework path.

### 2.8 Observability

`StartupTracer` records **per-successful-task** wall time around `run()` when it completes without failure. On partial failure, the manager may still print available traces. Suitable for **debug** dashboards; not a full distributed trace.

## 3. Module layout

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| **`core`** | `StartupTask`, `ExecutionPhase`, `StartupTaskProvider`, `TaskRegistry`, `Dag` (`sortTasks`, `planRunnableTasksInPhase`, …), `StartupDispatcher`, `StartupManager`, `StartupResult` (`PhaseResult`, `FullStartupResult`, …), `StartupTracer` |
| **`runtime`** | Optional wrappers: `LazyTask`, `TimeoutTask`, `PriorityTask` (delegate `executionPhase` too) |
| **`sample`** | Example `Init*` tasks (mixed phases) and `CoreTaskProvider` |
| **`app`** | `Application` registration, Compose UI, `runPhasedStartup`, benchmark |

`settings.gradle.kts` includes `:app`, `:core`, `:runtime`, `:sample`.

---

## 4. Core APIs

### 4.1 `StartupTask`

| Member | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| `id` | Unique string; referenced by other tasks’ `dependencies`. |
| `dependencies` | All listed tasks must **succeed** before this task runs; otherwise this task may be **skipped** if a dependency failed. |
| `runOnMainThread` | If `true`, `run()` on the main dispatcher; else on `Dispatchers.IO` (and subject to **IO** semaphore if configured). |
| `needWait` | Semantic hint for your app (splash / routing). |
| `priority` | Default `0`. Higher = earlier among ready tasks in the same phase (topo tie-break). |
| `executionPhase` | When the task is scheduled: `BeforeFirstFrame` (default), `AfterFirstFrame`, or `Idle`. |
| `suspend fun run()` | Actual work; use **suspend** I/O; avoid blocking the main thread. |

### 4.2 `StartupTaskProvider` and `TaskRegistry`

- Implement `StartupTaskProvider` with `fun provide(): List<StartupTask>`.
- `TaskRegistry.register(…)` in `Application` or a single composition root; `collectTasks()` **flatMaps** providers; `clear()` for tests.

### 4.3 `StartupManager`

```kotlin
val manager = StartupManager(
    tasks = TaskRegistry.collectTasks(),
    maxParallelIo = 4, // optional cap for concurrent non–main tasks; omit or null = unlimited
)

// Run all phases back-to-back in one coroutine (suspending); returns summary
val result: FullStartupResult = manager.start(printDag = true) { line -> Log.d("Startup", line) }

// Or run a single phase (e.g. after first frame), tracking successes and failures from earlier phases
val phase: PhaseResult = manager.startPhase(
    phase = ExecutionPhase.AfterFirstFrame,
    satisfiedFromEarlier = setOf("logger"),   // ids that succeeded in previous phases
    failedFromEarlier = emptySet(),          // ids that failed; dependents are skipped
    printDag = false,
)
```

- **`satisfiedFromEarlier`** should contain only **successful** task ids. **`failedFromEarlier`** should list **failed** ids so the planner can skip dependents.
- **`start` is `suspend`** and uses `coroutineScope` across phases. **`startPhase` is `suspend`** and uses `supervisorScope` for that phase’s tasks.

### 4.4 `runtime` module (optional)

| Class | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `LazyTask(delegate)` | At most one full successful `run()`; delegates `executionPhase` too. |
| `TimeoutTask(delegate, timeoutMs)` | `withTimeout` around `run()`. |
| `PriorityTask(delegate, priority)` | Overrides `priority` (and `executionPhase` from delegate). |

### 4.5 Result types (`core`)

- **`TaskFailure`**, **`SkippedTask`**, **`PhaseResult`**, **`FullStartupResult`** — see `StartupResult.kt`. Use `isOverallSuccess` / `hasTaskFailures` to drive UI or logging.

### 4.6 Phased startup helper (`app` sample)

- **`runPhasedStartup(activity, manager)`** — runs the three **phases** with **two Choreographer frame callbacks** and a **main Looper** `IdleHandler` between phases, and uses **`ensureActive()`** between steps so a **cancelled** scope (e.g. when the `Activity` is destroyed) stops starting further phases.

---

## 5. Using the framework in code

### 5.1 Define a task (with an execution phase)

```kotlin
class InitNetworkTask : StartupTask {
    override val id = "network"
    override val dependencies = listOf("logger")
    override val runOnMainThread = false
    override val needWait = false
    override val executionPhase = ExecutionPhase.AfterFirstFrame

    override suspend fun run() { /* ... */ }
}
```

### 5.2 Register and run

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        TaskRegistry.register(NetworkStartupProvider())
    }
}
```

```kotlin
suspend fun runAllPhasesInOneBlock() {
    val manager = StartupManager(TaskRegistry.collectTasks(), maxParallelIo = 4)
    val result = manager.start(printDag = BuildConfig.DEBUG)
    if (!result.isOverallSuccess) { /* log result.allFailures */ }
}
```

## 6. Running the sample and the benchmark

### Build

```bash
# Windows
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug

# macOS / Linux
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Run the **`app`** configuration in Android Studio.

The **comparison screen** measures:

1. **Naive sequential total** — `measureTimeMillis { runNaiveJetpackStyleStartup(...) }`
2. **Framework total** — `measureTimeMillis { runPhasedStartup(MainActivity, StartupManager(..., maxParallelIo = 4)) }` (real first-frame / idle gating, IO cap **4**)

The sample graph uses **mixed phases** (`logger` before first frame; `network` / `cache` after frames; `database` on idle) plus **DAG** parallelism where applicable. **Real device** times include **frame and idle** waits, not just task `delay`s.

`MainActivity` uses **`repeatOnLifecycle(Lifecycle.State.CREATED)`** so the benchmark coroutine is **cancelled when the `Activity` is destroyed** (in addition to structured concurrency from the lifecycle). `MainApplication` registers `CoreTaskProvider()`.

---

## 7. Integrating into another Android project

### 7.1 Option A: Include as Gradle modules (recommended for forks and monorepos)

1. Copy the **`core`** folder (and optionally **`runtime`**) or submodule it; **`include(":core")`** in `settings.gradle.kts`.
2. **`implementation(project(":core"))`** (+ **`runtime`** if needed), same Kotlin + **`kotlinx-coroutines-android`** as this repo.
3. Register providers in your **`Application`**; call **`start()`** or **`startPhase`** from a **lifecycle-aware** scope.

### 7.2 Where to start work (and cancellation)

- Prefer **`lifecycleScope.launch { … }`**, **`repeatOnLifecycle { … }`**, or **`viewModelScope`** so work is **cancelled** when the user leaves the screen, matching **`ensureActive()`** in phased helpers.
- For **process-wide** init without a UI, use a **`SupervisorJob` + `applicationScope`**, but be explicit about what must survive configuration changes.

### 7.3 Option B: Publish an AAR

- `maven-publish` for `:core` (and `:runtime`); POM should declare **kotlinx-coroutines-android**.

### 7.4 Testing

- `TaskRegistry.clear()` between tests. Assert on **`FullStartupResult`** / **`PhaseResult`** when you inject failing tasks. Keep tasks small and **mock** SDKs inside `run()`.

### 7.5 Multi-process

- Register **only in the process** that needs the singletons; use `if (isMainProcess) { ... }` when needed.

## 8. Relationship to Jetpack / other libraries

| Library / API | Role |
|---------------|------|
| **This framework** | DAG, phases, coroutines, optional IO cap, `PhaseResult` / failure reporting. |
| **AndroidX Startup** | Merge / manifest initializers; can coexist—use this for **explicit** graphs. |
| **WorkManager** | Post-startup, constrained background work. |
| **Hilt** | Inject dependencies **into** `run()`; ordering remains defined by the graph. |
| **Lifecycle (repeatOnLifecycle)** | Binds long startup coroutines to **UI lifetime**; recommended in `ComponentActivity` / Compose. |

---

## 9. Best practices and caveats

1. **Stable, unique `ids`**; dependencies must exist; **phase** order must not reference a “later” phase as a dependency.
2. **Short** main-thread work; heavy work on IO and/or **`Idle`** phase.
3. **No cycles** in the graph.
4. **`TaskRegistry.collectTasks()`** creates new instances from `provide()` each time; avoid accidental shared **mutable** state between runs.
5. **`priority`** does not override **edges**; it only reorders the ready queue.
6. **Handle `PhaseResult.failures` and `FullStartupResult.allFailures` in production** (log, crash reporting, or feature flags). **`CancellationException` is rethrown** and should not be treated as a task failure.
7. **Release:** disable or gate **`printDag`**, **`StartupTracer.print`**, and verbose **failure** strings as appropriate.
8. **`maxParallelIo`**: set from empirical testing (too low = underused cores; too high = storage or network **contention**).
